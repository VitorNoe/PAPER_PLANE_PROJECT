# ✈️ PAPER PLANE PROJECT 

*A Scientific and Creative Pursuit of Perfecting Paper Aviation*

---

## 🎯 Project Overview  
This open-source initiative aims to engineer **the ultimate paper airplane** through systematic experimentation, iterative design, and data-driven analysis. We're exploring the intersection of aerodynamics, material science, and artistic expression to dominate three key performance categories:

**🏆 Core Objectives**  
1. **Maximum Distance**  
   Target: 100+ feet straight-line flight  
   Current Record: 78.3 feet  

2. **Extended Air Time**  
   Target: 15+ seconds sustained flight  
   Current Record: 9.8 seconds  

3. **Aesthetic Excellence**  
   Developing visually striking designs that maintain flight performance
